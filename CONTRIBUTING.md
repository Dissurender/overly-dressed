## Contributing

If it's code, fixing typos or writing documentation, all contributions are valuable and highly appreciated.

## Setting up your environment

Fork the repository you'd like to work on! 
Then create a new branch for your work. I might write a more indepth tutorial on it later!
Make sure to run a git install before booting up the project!

## Finding Issues to Work On!

If you find an issue you'd like to work on I highly recommend posting in the related issue/feature you'd like to work on.
If you're shy but would still like to contribute please contact me in DMs. And I'll privately block off the issue for you!
